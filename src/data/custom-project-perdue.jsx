        Perdue is both a stop motion animation tale of our protagonist’s odyssey
        through land and sea and also an experiment in Dadaist creation.

      <h3>The Process</h3>
      <p>
        This project was created while spending a month on a rural farm in
        Sicily. Without access to a real studio or photography equipment, my
        friend and I challenged ourselves to construct a stop motion movie using
        the following rules:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Fifty words were collected from the members of the farm. Those words
            were dropped into a hat and thirteen words were pulled out at
            random. These thirteen words would be the foundation for a script
            that would later become a stop-motion film. (The final list of words
            can be seen in the credits).
          </li>
          <li>
            All scenes had to be constructed from the raw materials found on the
            farm (the excepction being a €10 budget to spend at the village
            shop).
          </li>
        </ul>
        Pre-production and filming took place during our free time before or
        after work shifts. The film was edited at the café outside the village
        church — the only location in town with a reliable power source! We are
        fairly impressed with the final product we were able to produce given
        the rustic setting, limited resources and narrative constraints.
      </p>

      <h3>The Concept</h3>
      <p>
        This project was an intentional experiment in the tradition of Dadaist
        art, a movement originating in 20th century France. Dadaism rejected
        logic and rationality in favor of chance, nonsense, and anti-bourgeois
        values. They notably never claimed an agenda for any of their pieces,
        instead leaving it up to each viewer to make up his or her mind about
        what — if anything — might lie beneath. By adopting radical chance as
        the foundation of Perdue, we merged traditional Dadaist values with the
        modernity of stop motion animation to produce a short film that takes
        each viewer on a unique journey to “somewhere".
